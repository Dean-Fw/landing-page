				<h3>About me</h3>
				<p>Hello, world! My name is Dean, a software engineer from the UK. I've worked primarily on backend projects and creating Infrastructure as Code solutions to host them. This has involved becoming very familiar with <b>.NET with C#</b>, <b>T-SQL</b>, <b>Terraform</b>, and <b>Azure DevOps pipelines</b>.</p>
				<p>While I spend most of my professional time working on the backend, I was professionally trained to be a full-stack engineer via a graduate scheme. This involved working on a few full-stack projects using <b>React</b>, <b>.NET with C#</b> and <b>T-SQL</b>. I have felt the front-end side of that training rust a bit. So I thought, why not put together a static site to brush those skills off while also improving my knowledge of building and deploying IaC solutions by hosting it!</p>

				<h3>Projects</h3>
				<p>This section is pretty empty at the moment, but I hope to be able to use this static site as a place to show off some of hte personal projects I work on. So if you are ever <b><i>extremely bored</i></b>, feel free to check this area out!</p>

						<h4>This Site!</h4>
						<p>The IaC for this site is written in <b>Terraform</b>, which configures a standard storage account and a static site container to host the website files. The site is composed solely of <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b>, with a touch of <b>JavaScript</b>. When building the site I wanted to focus on <b>responsive CSS design</b>, leading me to learn a lot about <b>container and media queries</b>, along with <b>custom CSS properties</b>.</p>
						<p>To deploy my IaC and Static site files, I chose to use <b>GitHub Actions</b>. The technology was new to me, as I in my working life I have only really used <b>Azure DevOps pipelines</b> to set up automated jobs. <b>Actions</b> are ran from YAML workflow files which felt to be a more event based way of triggering your jobs. Overall I quite like a lot of the aspects of <b>Actions and Workflows</b> and hope to improve on my skills in the area through creating future projects.</p>
